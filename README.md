This is a very simple REACT game I made for practice after a couple of days learning React. It is uploaded here: https://stick-skater-man.netlify.app/

The game is played by pressing down on the 'S' and 'F' keys which represent the back and front wheels of the skateboard. The game is meant to feel like using a fingerboard, but obviously using your computer keyboard instead of a finger board.

Lifting one finger off the keyboard wil cause the skater to do a manual, and removing the second finger from the keyboard whilst in a manual (on the back wheels) will do an ollie. To land the ollie both wheels must be pressed down before the skater lands. It is possible to land directly into another manual but this requires more precise timing just before the skater lands.
